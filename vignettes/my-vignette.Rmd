This starter package allows users to perform various geometric operations like 
calculate distance between two parallel lines, distance between two n dimensional 
vectors, intersection of lines in 3-Dimensional space and determine if two 
infinite lines are perpendicular in n-dimensional space. Our motivation in 
creating this package was to allow users with minimal experience in R 
programming to be able to perform these geometric calculations easily.

```{r setup}
library(CoordGeomR)
